Hi, I’m @Zephyros1938

I code in primarily C#, Rust, and C++, but am very versed in Python & Javascript, along with NodeJS.

I work on many different passion projects, and am currently learning C++.

I can't commit much due to personal roadblocks, but i host my own gitea server at git.zephyros1938.org, so i might be more active there!

Cheetah Blue.
